# LittleLemon
LittleLemon app developed using Django for the Back-End Developer Capstone course offered by Meta. This Capstone project enables you to demonstrate multiple skills by solving an authentic real-world problem. The project aims to test your abilities in full-stack back-end development in a real-life scenario by composing a Django web app. Each module includes a brief recap of, and links to, content that you have covered in previous courses in this program.
